<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
A winlink net is an amateur radio net, which members check in regulary, in our case once a week, to create a list of stations that could aid in case of a catastrophe.
It encourages participating stations to use winlink regulary and train the operators skills. Furthermore: It shall connect likeminded operators to engange in further testing and training.
<h3>How does it work in detail?</h3>
Operators check in by filling out the form (down below) and sending it to the net control, idealy ccing the backup. Checkin forms are then evaluated once a week, every Sunday 12UTC and the results published to this website. The outcome is a map and a list containing all participating stations, as well as a "callbook" containing vital informations. This callbook is intended for download and offline storage, i shall be used to quickly connect operators in case of an emergency.
It is important to note, that operators are not bound to a specific day to check in: Many of us are not able to get on the air regulary or to specific times. I, as an example, are only able to work /p, as i can not put up any antennas at my QTH. Therefore telnet checkins are also accepted, but not encouraged.
<h3>What is collected?</h3>
Callsign of the operator, First name, Location (Locator or Lat/lon), Bands of operation, modes of operation, times of operation (optional) and further capabilities (optional).
<h3>Check in form</h3>
The fields are separated by a ";". Spaces do not matter, as long as ";" is not used within the text, only as a delimiter.<br><br>
